Factory Prototype
=================

Just playing with code for some "Machine" objects that can be connected
together and feed their outputs to the next input.

A short search turned up no tutorials on this type of code, so I want
to play around with it a bit to get something running.

I'm stuck in a non-unity environment so I will have to fake the update
loop and delta time for now. No problem.
